# D3-challenge
# Data Journalism and D3

## Background

Analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings.
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://data.census.gov/cedsci/](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml).
The data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 


### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)

* Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables, such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements:

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.


### Bonus: Impress the Boss (Optional Assignment)

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

* Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. 
* Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. 


#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip

* Use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization to host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

* Use the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged) as a resource.

* Check out [David Gotz's example](https://bl.ocks.org/davegotz/bd54b56723c154d25eedde6504d30ad7) to see how you should implement tooltips with d3-tip.
